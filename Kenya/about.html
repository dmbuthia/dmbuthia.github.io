       Kenya's climate varies from tropical along the coast to temperate inland 
       to arid in the north and northeast parts of the country. 
       The area receives a great deal of sunshine every month. It is usually 
       cool at night and early in the morning inland at higher elevations.

        The "long rains" season occurs from March/April to May/June. 
        The "short rains" season occurs from October to November/December. 
        The rainfall is sometimes heavy and often falls in the afternoons and 
        evenings. The temperature remains high throughout these months of 
        tropical rain. The hottest period is February and March, leading into 
        the season of the long rains, and the coldest is in July, until mid-August
